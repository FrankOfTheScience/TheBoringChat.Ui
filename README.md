## TheBoringChat - UI

#### Description:

This is the Frontend for TheBoringChat, a really boring group (or 1:1) chat.

#### Context:

This project was made as a demo, to experiment with `.NET SignalR` library, since I am a Backend Dev the UI has been totally improvised using `React`, so I messed up here and forth specially with `CSS` trying to find workarounds for darkMode for example ðŸ˜….

#### State of the project:

This Frontend Project is done, maybe I am going to change some color here and there but major improvements won't be released on this repo until I find new ways to experiment with backend, which is my main focus.

#### Backend

You can find the Backend repo [HERE](https://github.com/FrankOfTheScience/TheBoringChat)

## Functional Instructions

0. **Follow the previous installation and setup instructions**
   
1. **Visit the frontend on localhost:**

   - If Chatroom isn't provided you will be joint to the general chat
   - Provide the same Chatroom name to join a private chat with clients who provided the same Chatroom name

3. **Optional step: Test the chat with multiple clients:**
   - Open another browser or an incognito browsing window.
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000` to create another instance of the frontend and try chatting between the two clients
